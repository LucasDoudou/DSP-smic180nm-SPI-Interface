WARNING (XSTRM-20): Output Stream file '/home/student/Desktop/Workspace/LVS/6_AND_test.calibre.db' already exists. It will be overwritten.
INFO (XSTRM-217): Reading the layer map file, /home/student/Desktop/Workspace/smic18mmrf/smic18mmrf/smic18mmrf.layermap
INFO (XSTRM-162): You have not used the viaMap option. If the OpenAccess design has native oaVia instances, use the -viaMap option for preserving oaVia instances in a Stream Out - Stream In round trip. Using the -viaMap option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design.  For details on the viaMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.
