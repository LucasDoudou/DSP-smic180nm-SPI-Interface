## 📖 Overview
This project implements the basic functionality of a **DSP48A1** chip. 
All design and simulation work was carried out in **Cadence Virtuoso** on the **SMIC 180nm technology node**.
Finished Schematic and **Layout by hand!** including DRC, LVS and PEX all passed.

The design integrates:
- ✅ 4-bit Full Adder  
- ✅ 5×6 Multiplier  
- ✅ 11-bit Full Adder  
- ✅ 12-bit Register  
- ✅ SPI Communication (**Serial-In and Parallel-Out**)
